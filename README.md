# link-shortener

How to use:

- Configure settings.ini with your credentials, template can be found
in the Documentation section
- Run 'docker-compose build', then 'docker-compose up'

How to test:

- Run 'docker-compose down' and 'docker-compose up', the DB has to be fresh
for the tests to work
- Run './test.sh' (and 'chmod a+rx test.sh' before if not allowed)
- All or most of the warnings should be about async syntax deprecation,
as sanic_oauth has old/deprecated versions of dependencies (httpx et al.)
