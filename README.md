Description: For now, a rudimentary project connecting MySQL database to
a Sanic app via their respective Docker containers.
This connection is tested using a simple API for creating and displaying cats.


How to use:

- Run 'docker-compose build' and 'docker-compose up'
- Use the requests package to INSERT and SELECT data from the MySQL database
